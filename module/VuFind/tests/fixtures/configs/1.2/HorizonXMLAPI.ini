[pickUpLocations]
; This setting is used to define library codes and named values which are used by the
; system to indicate the library at which a hold is to be collected.  Horizon uses
; the descriptive name to place the hold, not the code (which can be assigned
; arbitrarily)
locationID = "locationDisplay"

;Holds are optional.
[Holds]
; HMACKeys - A list of hold form element names that will be analyzed for consistency
; during hold form processing. Most users should not need to change this setting.
HMACKeys = item_id

; notify - The method by which users are notified when their hold / request is 
; available. Must correspond with a Horizon system setting.
notify = "e-mail"

; defaultRequiredDate - A colon-separated list used to set the default "not required
; after" date for holds in the format days:months:years
; e.g. 0:1:0 will set a "not required after" date of 1 month from the current date
defaultRequiredDate = 0:1:0

; Horizon appears to rely on text values rather than codes for determining the pickup
; location. This sets the default pickup location and MUST match one of the locations
; listed in pickUpLocations
defaultPickUpLocation = "locationID"

; extraHoldFields - A colon-separated list used to display extra visible fields in
; the place holds form. Supported values are "comments", "requiredByDate" and
; "pickUpLocation"
